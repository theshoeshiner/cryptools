I built a web app to track and balance crypto portfolios 

Just as a disclamer: If you consider yourself a rapid day trader, trying to beat the market through timing, insider info, and instinct this app won't really augment that strategy. It's designed to help alert you to broader changes in your porfolio's exposure. The changes it's measuring happen over days and weeks, not seconds or minutes. But still feel free to try this out.

What is Rebalancing
Rebalancing is a technique used to manage risk in finanical portfolios (usually traditional assets - stocks, bonds, etc). If you're not familiar with the concept of portfolio balancing it will help to understand that first (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp). But essentially it means managing your exposure to risk by only having a certain percentage of your portfolio in specific assets. e.g. If you want 75% of your assets in low risk currencies, and 25% in high risk, then as each of those assets goes up and down in value, you will occasionally need to buy and sell from one to the other to maintain that balance. If your high risk assets become 50% of your total worth, then (per your own allocation) you are too exposed, and would need to sell some of that high risk asset and buy more of the other, and vice versa. Consequently, this means you are almost always buying low and selling high. So regardless of how emotionally attached to some crazy alt coin, there will come time when its reasonable to sell, and that time is usually before your emotions tell you too. If that altcoin goes up by 10x, this app will likely indicate that you need to sell some (not all, but some). This app is not going to tell you to HODL. It's going to tell you to hold on until it's fiscally responsible to slowly sell some. Could you miss the 100x boom? Maybe. But you might also be avoiding the -100x bust. That's what controlling risk is about. The thresholds for when an alert is triggered are adjustable, but a 5/25 rule is common (https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/03/larry-swedroe-525-rebalancing-rule/). Meaning if an asset is out of balance by 5% of your worth, or 25% of the assets value, then it's time to adjust. With more volatile assets you may see improved returns with a 5/15 rule, but remember, all you're really doing here is capitalizing on the swings between asset classes. If the *entire market* moves up or down, you aren't going to magically beat it, and lowering these thresholds too far just means excess transaction fees and more taxes.

What does the app do
This web app will allow you to specify the percent of your portfolio you want allocated to each asset. As the prices move it alerts you when things get out of balance, and can tell you what adjustment you need to make to bring it back into balance. It does this by assessing the value of your portfolio on a regular basis (30min) and comparing the imbalance with your configured thresholds (see 5/25 rule above). If an asset imbalance passes the threshold it sends out an email letting you know. For certain volatile assets I've had this happen 4-5 times in a week, and for stable assets they will go months without ever needing an adjustment. Commonly what you'll find is one unstable asset that needs adjustment often, and during those adjustments you end up inherently correcting other imbalances. The portfolio summary will tell you how much of each asset you need to buy/sell, and you can exchange between the two that are furthest out of balance. 
The app also tracks the history of your portfolio, and you can see a chart of the value over time, as well as a pie chart of the current distribution. Nothing fancy, just enough to give you a picture of what's going on. There's more information tracked in the database that I just don't have exposed yet.

Limitations
- Price data comes from the cryptocompare.com API. You will need to create an account there and generate a free API key (https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/how-to-use-our-api/). My app acts as a client, gathering that price data for you using your API key. There is a some caching magic that happens under the hood such that your API key wont get used nearly as often as you might expect, but either way this is required for each user during registration.
- Unfortunately, I don't yet integrate directly with exchanges. This means you configure your balances manually. And when you make adjustments you come back and update your balances. If you have 20 coins each on 10 different exchanges, then that's 200 rows, but that's hopefully not the average user. Given that adjustments are only necessary every few weeks (if that), manually updating balances isn't a big deal. You enter each balance per currency and exchange, and the app can handle adding up all the balances for the same currency across exchanges. I do hope that in the future I can have these balances updated automatically via direct integration with exchange APIs. But even then that would be limited to the top exchanges, so there may always be a need to manually enter.
- The list of currencies and exchanges comes from cryptocompare. If the currency isn't listed there then this app can't track it. As for the exchanges, per the above, there is no direct integration so technically it doesn't matter which exchange you select for each balance. It's currently just used to help you manage the balances. However in the future I plan to use that information to optimize the trades that are necessary to balance your portfolio.
- The reserve currency for everything is USD. I would like to eventually allow other currencies to be selected as the reserve, but that gets significantly more complex, especially if you allow cryptos to be selected. So for right now, all history and reporting is in USD.
- In regards to the pace - what's up right now is probably a months worth of "real" work, but it took me about 10 months to get here. So obviously this is not my full time job. I feel it's stable enough that others may find it useful, and I myself have been using it for 8 months, but we'll see what the future holds.
- I have to charge each user a $1.13 fee after email confirmation. Just kidding wtf would I do that?
